I'm a shareholder and a Director, only because "full time, multi-tasking ninja is not an actual job title".

Joke aside I'm still finding time to play around new technologies and stay more or less up to date. The product we're working on is evolving quite fast, both from a technological and a business point of view.


## Roles

Shareholder, [Syncordis](http://www.syncordisconsulting.com)

Director France, Syncordis Consulting
