title: Installing Docker on a Raspberry Pi and hacking a ScrollPhat

I started playing with Docker in 2016. I am still amazed by its power and simplicity. Being confined at home and kind of bored on this rainy day I resumed hacking a Raspberry Pi with Docker, connected to IPad and now plugging a ScrollPhat I found to monitor cpu, temp and number of docker images running.
