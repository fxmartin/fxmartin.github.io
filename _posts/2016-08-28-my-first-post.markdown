I’ve been playing around with quite a lot of technologies lately, putting together Raspberry PIs, deploying docker swarm and initiating a domotic project based on Jeedom.

So far I was keeping my notes on Evernote. But I realised that without the help found on all kind of blogs on the Internet I would have not been able to achieve half of it.

That’s why I decided to look for a blog solution. Considering that I’m now heavily using http://wwww.github.com to fork projects and store my own ones, it was only a natural step to look for a blog solution based on github.

This is how I ended up with deploying and publishing with [Github](http://github.com) and more particularly with [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/)

I hope that the entries of this blog will be helpful to someone somewhere.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
