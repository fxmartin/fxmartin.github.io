title: Why this blog ?

I’ve been playing around with quite a lot of technologies lately, putting together [Raspberry PIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), playing with [**docker**](https://www.docker.com/) and even more so since the arrival of its [new native mac version](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), deploying docker [swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/) and initiating an home automation project based on [Jeedom](https://www.jeedom.com/site/fr/).

As a Mac addict I used to run virtual machines, using [VMWare Fusion Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion-pro.html), to have a working release of the product my company is deploying for our clients. I encountered [Vagrant](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/homestead) while developing a quick and dirty solution with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and finally stumbled on Docker. From day one I found it amazing. I'm working on a Docker package of the proprietary product we're implementing. More on that on a later post potentially.

So far I was keeping my notes on Evernote. But I realised that without the help found on all kind of blogs on the Internet I would have not been able to achieve half of it.

That’s why I decided to start sharing my findings. The first logical step was obviously to look for a blog solution. During my research on blog solutions I encountered several posts ([here](http://blog.ixartz.com/my-experience-about-moving-from-Wordpress-to-Jekyll/) and [here](http://andybeger.com/2016/06/20/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) and [here](https://superdevresources.com/github-pages-jekyll/)) where educated users explained why they moved away from Wordpress and migrated to Jekyll. Considering that I’m now heavily using [Github](http://wwww.github.com) to fork projects and store my own ones, it was kind of an obvious step to go for a solution hosted on github. I'm still a command line guy at the heart. I will explain in more details why I went down that route in a future post but to make a long story short, I ended up with deploying and publishing with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a nice [theme: Jekyll-Mono](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono), which I slightly amended.

I hope that the entries of this blog will be helpful to someone somewhere.

PS.: the photo above is from the cluster of PI3 I put together to experiment with docker swarm on a real scale. More on that also later ;-)
