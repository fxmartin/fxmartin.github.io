title: Connecting a Raspberry PI 4 to an iPad Pro

While browsing the Internet I stumbled on the [video](https://youtu.be/IR6sDcKo3V8) from the Tech Craft channel on how to connect a Raspberry Pi 4 to an iPad Pro. I've been using my iPad Pro 12"9 inches for a bit more than a year now and still trying to perform as much as possible from it, with the ultimate goal of using it as a full replacement for my laptop.

Do not get me wrongs I love the form factor, the light weight and the battery duration. Still I was struggling to perform the technical experiments I was looking for. For example I started to go through the last book from Adrian Rosebrock [Raspberry Pi for computer vision](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/raspberry-pi-for-computer-vision/). But to play with the examples you need a working Python environment with OpenCV and Numpy installed. This is not possible on the iPad. I installed [Pythonista for iOS](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) but OpenCV is not included.
