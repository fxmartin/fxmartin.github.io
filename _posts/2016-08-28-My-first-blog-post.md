I’ve been playing around with quite a lot of technologies lately, putting together Raspberry PIs, playing with **docker** and even more so since the arrival of its [new native mac version](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), deploying docker swarm and initiating a domotic project based on [Jeedom](https://www.jeedom.com/site/fr/).

So far I was keeping my notes on Evernote. But I realised that without the help found on all kind of blogs on the Internet I would have not been able to achieve half of it.

That’s why I decided to look for a blog solution. Considering that I’m now heavily using [Github](http://wwww.github.com) to fork projects and store my own ones, it was only a natural step to look for a blog solution based on github.

This is how I ended up with deploying and publishing with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and a nice [theme: Jekyll-Mono](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono) I slightly amended.

I hope that the entries of this blog will be helpful to someone somewhere.
