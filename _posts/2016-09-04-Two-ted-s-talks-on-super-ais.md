title: Two interesting and complementary Ted's talks on super Artificial Intelligence
author: FX

One of my morning rituals is to watch a couple of [Ted talks](https://www.ted.com/talks). I do not know if you're familiar with this site but in short, it aims at spreading ideas from today's thinkers and researchers. I did not take the time to investigate how they choose their speakers so it might not be objective but almost every video I watched so far stirred my curiosity and generated thoughts.

I do not choose the videos myself but let twitter (I follow TED talks) bring them to my attention and based on the excerpt I watch it... or not...

The first video I watched this morning is a talk from [Chris Urmson, the Director of Self-Driving Cars at GoogleX](https://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_urmson). It obviously made me marvel at the technology behind: [How a driverless car sees the road](https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_urmson_how_a_driverless_car_sees_the_road?language=en).

The second one from [Nick Bostrom](http://www.nickbostrom.com/) is a kind of mirror response as it questions the humanity future with super artificial intelligences: [What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are?language=e)
